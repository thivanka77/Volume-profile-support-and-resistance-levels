V1 -visible range volume profile - done

V2 - Add fixed range volume profile - done

V3 - draw support and resistance lines on low volume nodes
  Highight low volume nodes as support and resistance and draw support and resistance zone boxes in the chart.
  It will identify the support and resistance levels based on the lowest volume node. 
  We can add a function to define the lowest volume node distance from current candle.
  There should be an option to change the number of support and resistance lines drawn on the chart.

V4 - Add SMC visible confirmation
